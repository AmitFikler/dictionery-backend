# Dictionary-Backend ðŸ“–

Server side for a dictionary app.

I first uploaded all the words to Dynamodb(AWS), a process that took two days! ðŸ¥µ <br>
I then built the routers that can be seen below. ðŸ‘‡<br>
In the end, I uploaded everything with serverless to AWS and the client side turns to the url I got from Amazon.

## Route `/word`

---

<br>

### GET `/:word` - returns all definition of this word.

if word has more than one parts of speech will return all words part of speech, else, will return a word + definition + part of speech.
